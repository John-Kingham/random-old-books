# Random Old Books

Random Old Books is website built for a fictional retailer of the same name, which sells vintage books printed more than 20 years ago.

The business has one physical book store, where it also holds regular events with authors (events are free, but participants often buy books while they're at the store), and it has a mail-order subscription box service where subscribers are sent one book per month.

The company's unique selling proposition is that it believes in the positive power of random events and chance encounters, so it adds a dash of randomness to its customers' lives by placing books randomly on its bookshelves and by sending out a random book each month to subscription box subscribers.

## User Experience Design

### Site Goals (Strategy Plane)

The business is struggling to remain viable as it doesn't have enough customers and the customers it has don't make enough repeat purchases. To help fix this problem, the website has the following goals:

1. Raise awareness of the business and what it has to offer (a vintage bookstore, a subscription service and regular events)
2. Maintain the company's sophisticated buy slightly quirky branding
3. Make it easy for users to find and contact the store
4. Inform users about upcoming events and make it easy for them to book events
5. Inform users about the subscription box service and make it easy for them to sign up for a trial
6. Make it easy for users to subscribe to the company's free monthly e-newsletter, where it highlights new stock, upcoming events and the benefits of the subscription box

### User Personas (Strategy Plane)

- **The Adventurous Browser**: Loves the thrill of unpredictability. Often buys books from authors they've never heard of, accepting whatever fate hands them.
- **The Online Surprise Seeker**: Prefers reading experiences where every month brings a surprise. Embraces the challenge of reading whatever book they get, treating it as an opportunity to experience new things.
- **The Conversational Enthusiast**: Values engaging discussions more than just the books themselves. Enjoys interacting with authors and readers, asking thought-provoking questions, and participating in lively debates.

### User Stories (Scope Plane)
**User Story 1**: A professional-looking, responsive, user-friendly interface

- As an **Adventurous Browser**, I want to see a professional website that looks good on various screen sizes and is easy to navigate, so I'm not put off by a poor user experience.

**User Story 2**: Enticing images and descriptions of the business, its products and services

- As an **Adventurous Browser**, I want to learn about the business, its products and services, so I can decide if I'd like to visit the store.

**User Story 3**: Location, opening hours and contact details

- As an **Adventurous Browser**, I want to be able to easily find the store's location and opening hours, so I know where and when to visit.

**User Story 4**: Subscription box subscription form

- As an **Online Surprise Seeker**, I want to be able to easily find a subscription box sign-up form, so I can subscribe immediately.

**User Story 5**: List of events and booking form

- As a **Conversational Enthusiast**, I want to see a list of upcoming events and a booking form, so I can decide which event to attend and book my place.

**User Story 6**: E-newsletter sign-up form

- As an **Conversational Enthusiast**, I want to be able to easily subscribe to the company's free e-newsletter, so I can be kept up to date with the latest events and book my seat before they've all gone.

### Site Structure (Structure Plane)

To flesh out the structure of the site at a very high level, I came up with a list of sections that would fulfil all of the user stories and arranged them onto a handful of web pages, as shown in the diagram below.
