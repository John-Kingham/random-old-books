# Random Old Books

Random Old Books is website built for a fictional retailer of the same name, which sells vintage books printed more than 20 years ago. The business has one physical book store, where it also holds regular events with authors, and it has a subscription box service where subscribers are sent one book per month.

The company's unique selling proposition is that it believes in the positive power of random events and chance encounters, so it adds a dash of randomness to its customers' lives by placing books randomly on its bookshelves and by sending out a random book each month to its subscription box subscribers.
