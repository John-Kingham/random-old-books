# Random Old Books

Random Old Books is a website built for a fictional retailer of the same name that sells vintage books printed more than 20 years ago.

The business has one physical bookshop, where it also holds regular events with authors (events are free, but participants often buy books while they're at the store), and it has a mail-order subscription box service where subscribers are sent one random book per month.

The company's unique selling proposition is that it believes in the positive power of random events and chance encounters, so it adds a dash of randomness to its customers' lives by placing books randomly on its bookshelves and by sending out a random book each month to subscription box subscribers.

## User Experience Design

### Site Goals (Strategy Plane)

The backstory is that the Random Old Books business is struggling to remain viable as it doesn't have enough customers and its existing customers don't make enough repeat purchases. To help fix this problem, the manager wanted a new website to be developed with the following goals:

1. Raise awareness of the business and its services (a vintage bookstore, a subscription service and regular events)
2. Maintain the company's relatively understated branding
3. Make it easy for users to find and contact the store
4. Inform users about upcoming events and make it easy for them to book events
5. Inform users about the subscription box service and make it easy for them to sign up for a trial
6. Make it easy for users to subscribe to the company's free monthly e-newsletter, which promotes the store, upcoming events and the subscription box service

### User Personas (Strategy Plane)

There are three main user personas, one for each of the business's three main services (bookstore, subscription box, events):

**The Adventurous Browser**: Loves the thrill of unpredictability. Often buys books from authors they've never heard of, accepting whatever fate hands them.

**The Online Surprise Seeker**: Prefers reading experiences where every month brings a surprise. Embraces the challenge of reading whatever book they get, treating it as an opportunity to experience new things.

**The Conversational Enthusiast**: Values engaging discussions more than just the books themselves. Enjoys interacting with authors and readers, asking thought-provoking questions, and participating in lively debates.

### Site Structure (Structure Plane)

To flesh out the structure of the site at a very high level, I came up with a list of sections that would fulfil all of the user stories and arranged them onto a handful of web pages, as shown in the diagram below.
