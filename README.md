# Random Old Books

Random Old Books is a website built for a fictional retailer of the same name that sells vintage books printed more than 20 years ago.

The business has one physical bookshop, where it also holds regular events with authors (events are free, but participants often buy books while they're at the store), and it has a mail-order subscription box service where subscribers are sent one random book per month.

The company's unique selling proposition is that it believes in the positive power of random events and chance encounters, so it adds a dash of randomness to its customers' lives by placing books randomly on its bookshelves and by sending out a random book each month to subscription box subscribers.

## User Experience Design

### Site Goals (Strategy Plane)

The backstory is that the Random Old Books business is struggling to remain viable as it doesn't have enough customers and its existing customers don't make enough repeat purchases. To help fix this problem, the manager wanted a new website to be developed with the following goals:

1. Raise awareness of the business and its services (a vintage bookstore, a subscription service and regular events).
2. Maintain the company's relatively understated branding.
3. Make it easy for users to find and contact the store.
4. Inform users about upcoming events and make it easy for them to book events.
5. Inform users about the subscription box service and make it easy for them to sign up for a trial.
6. Make it easy for users to subscribe to the company's free monthly e-newsletter.

### User Personas (Strategy Plane)

There are three main user personas, one for each of the business's three main services (bookstore, subscription box, events):

**The Adventurous Browser**: Loves the thrill of browsing through stores, hoping to discover the unexpected. Often buys books from authors they've never heard of, accepting whatever fate hands them.

**The Online Surprise Seeker**: Prefers reading experiences where every month brings a surprise. Embraces the challenge of reading whatever book they get, treating it as an opportunity to experience new things.

**The Conversational Enthusiast**: Values engaging discussions more than just the books themselves. Enjoys interacting with authors and other readers, asking thought-provoking questions and participating in lively debates.

### User Stories (Scope Plane)

#### User Story 1: A professional-looking, responsive, user-friendly interface

- As an **Adventurous Browser**, I want to see a professional website that looks good on various screen sizes and is easy to navigate, so I'm not put off by a poor user experience.

#### User Story 2: Enticing images and descriptions of the business, its products and services

- As an **Adventurous Browser**, I want to learn about the business, its products and services, so I can decide if I'd like to visit the store.

#### User Story 3: Location, opening hours and contact details

- As an **Adventurous Browser**, I want to be able to easily find the store's location and opening hours, so I know where and when to visit.

#### User Story 4: Subscription box subscription form

- As an **Online Surprise Seeker**, I want to be able to easily find a subscription box sign-up form, so I can subscribe immediately.

#### User Story 5: List of events and booking form

- As a **Conversational Enthusiast**, I want to see a list of upcoming events and a booking form, so I can decide which event to attend and book my place.

#### User Story 6: E-newsletter sign-up form

- As an **Conversational Enthusiast**, I want to be able to easily subscribe to the company's free e-newsletter, so I can be kept up to date with the latest events and book my seat before they've all gone.

### Site Structure (Structure Plane)

To realise all of the user stories, the site has the following sections:

- A **Navigation** section so users can easily navigate around the site (user story 1).
- A **Homepage Hero** section with an enticing image of the store and a good elevator pitch for the business and its services (user story 2).
- A **Why Random** section that explains why users should read (and buy) random books (user story 2).
- A **Services** section with images and brief descriptions for each of the company's three services (user story 2).
- A **Subscription Box Hero** section with an enticing image and description of the subscription box service (user story 2).
- An **Events Hero** section with an enticing image and summary of the events (user story 2).
- A **Contact Details** section where users can find all relevant contact details (user story 3).
- A **Subscription Box Details** section detailing the features and benefits of the service (user story 4).
- A **Subscription Form** section that contains the sign-up form (user story 4).
- A **Thank You** section that contains a thank-you message and a homepage button (user story 4).
- An **Events List** section containing details of upcoming events (user story 5).
- An **Event Booking Form** section that contains the event booking form (user story 5).
- A **Newsletter Sign-up** section containing a description of the newsletter and a sign-up button (user story 6).

These sections were allocated to various web pages based on their importance and the intuitive flow of information that most users would expect (e.g. putting the list of events directly above the event booking form).

The resulting website structure is shown below.

### Colour Palette, Fonts, Images and Content (Surface Plane)

#### Colour palette

The site uses the following "vintage" colours, which suit the company's position as a seller of old books:

- #567a79 (a dark green) as the primary background colour
- #504746 (a dark brown) as the second background colour
- #FFFFFF (white) as the light text colour on dark backgrounds

#### Custom fonts

THe site uses two custom fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/):

- Headings: [Limelight](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Limelight) (a vintage font that contrasts strongly with the body font)
- Body text: [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand) (a clean san serif font that should be easy to read on screens)
