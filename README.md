# Random Old Books

Random Old Books is website built for a fictional retailer of the same name, which sells vintage books printed more than 20 years ago. 

The business has one physical book store, where it also holds regular events with authors (events are free, but participants often buy books while they're at the store), and it has a mail-order subscription box service where subscribers are sent one book per month.

Its unique selling proposition is that it believes in the positive power of random events and chance encounters, so it adds a dash of randomness to its customers' lives by placing books randomly on its bookshelves and by sending out a random book each month to its subscription box subscribers.

## UX

### Site Goals

The business is struggling to remain viable as it doesn't have enough customers and the customers it has don't make enough repeat purchases. To help fix this problem, the website has the following goals:

1. Raise awareness of the business and what it has to offer (a vintage bookstore, a subscription service and regular events)
2. Maintain the company's sophisticated buy slightly quirky branding
3. Make it easy for users to find and contact the store
4. Inform users about upcoming events and make it easy for them to book events
5. Inform users about the subscription box service and make it easy for them to sign up for a trial.
6. Make it easy for users to subscribe to the company's free monthly e-newsletter, where it highlights new stock, upcoming events and the benefits of the subscription box.

### User Stories

**As a Shopper**:
- I need to see a professional website that looks good on various screen sizes and is easy to navigate, so I'm not put off by a poor user experience.
- I need to know what sort of books the business sells, so I know if it sells the kind of books I'm interested in. 

**As a Local Shopper**:
- I need to see what the store looks like inside, so I can decide if it's worth visiting.
- I need to be able to easily find the store's location and opening hours, so I know where and when to visit.

**As an Online Shopper**:
- I need to see a description of the subscription service, so I know if it's something I'd like to subscribe to.
- I need to be able to easily subscribe to the subscription box service online, so I don't have to call or visit the store.

**As an Event Fan**:
- I need to see a list of upcoming events, so I can see if they're the sort of events I'm interested in.
- I need to be able to easily book seats at an event online, so I don't have to bother calling the store.
- I need to be able to easily subscribe to the monthly e-newsletter, so I can be one of the first to find out about new upcoming events and book a seat before they've all gone.
